# BeRest

The travel and leisure web system is a website that helps facilitate and
automate the process of planning, booking and managing trips using the latest
technologies. Key features that have been implemented include the ability to
register new users, authorize existing users, view useful travel information,
add countries to favorites and, in the future, develop travel booking
functionality. The function of sending a message to the company's corporate mail
with a user's comment and a welcome message from the company in the reverse
direction is also implemented. Registration and authorization of users are key
functions of modern web systems, as they provide security, personalization and
control of access to system resources. My Travel & Leisure web system and
features allow users to create accounts, access advanced site features, and
customize user interactions.
